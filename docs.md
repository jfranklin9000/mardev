### the `~micnus-tarwyl-haltem-linhut--dilhul-talbes-wolnyx-lasbud` docs

*by `~master-morzod`*

The universe of Urbit is utterly foreign. Galactic identities abound. Layers
of neologisms, runes, and lapidary conventions combine with disorienting
effect, even to -- no, *especially to* the experienced programmer. There are
[many](posts) [resources](docs) to [study](whitepaper), and endless paths
within. Most are necessary, none are themselves sufficient.

These docs are merely supplemental, harboring no dillusions of completeness or
supercession. But there are benefits to re-explanation -- to different words.
This is an attempt to support the practical study of Urbit: first with a
re-examination of Hoon and its docs, then with a narrative reference to its
features and capabilities, from simple scripts to full-blown apps. Arranged in
ascending order of difficulty, these docs (*will* __*__) target the familiar,
if not yet capable Urbit afficianado.

By way of introduction:

- the [Urbit overview](https://urbit.org/posts/overview/)
- a [welcome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1qroWiZF90)
- a response to [common objections](https://urbit.org/posts/objections/)

Or, for those who prefer to dive deep without oxygen:

- Curtis Yarvin's infamous LambdaConf talk ([official](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTisf4oxIFo) and [bootleg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZ3GkeU9kg) recordings)
- the [Urbit whitepaper](https://media.urbit.org/whitepaper.pdf)
