### the `~mardev` docs

*by `~master-morzod`*

The universe of Urbit is utterly foreign. Galactic identities abound. Layers
of neologisms, runes, and lapidary conventions combine with disorienting
effect, even to -- no, *especially to* the experienced programmer. There are
[many](http://urbit.org/posts) [resources](http://urbit.org/docs) to
[study](https://media.urbit.org/whitepaper.pdf), and endless paths within.
Most are necessary, none are themselves sufficient.

These docs are merely supplemental, harboring no dillusions of completeness or
supercession. But there are benefits to re-explanation -- to different words.
This is an attempt to support the practical study of Urbit: first with a
re-examination of Hoon and its docs, then with a narrative reference to its
features and capabilities, from simple scripts to full-blown apps. Arranged in
ascending order of difficulty, these docs (*will* __*__) target the familiar,
if not yet capable Urbit afficianado.

> __*__ This is entirely a work-in-progress -- subject to revision,
> replacement, or outright disappearance.

Or, for those who prefer to dive deep without oxygen:

- Curtis Yarvin's infamous LambdaConf talk ([official](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTisf4oxIFo) and [bootleg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZ3GkeU9kg) recordings)
